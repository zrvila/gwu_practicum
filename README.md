Spring 2022 GWU Business Analytics Practicum Project

For our Practicum Project at The George Washington University, we were
sponsored by our client, Navanti Group, to produce a real-time sentiment analysis and
tracking dashboard, which will aggregate and display COVID-19 misinformation transfer
into the “mainstream”. To carry out the analysis, we elected to use social media posts from
the Twitter and Gettr platforms as a proxy for public opinion on the subject. Throughout
the course of the semester, we met regularly with our client to refine the project scope,
provide updates on the progress of the project, and incorporate feedback on our efforts.
The final dashboard product is a result of those efforts and the analysis therein, which
provides actionable insights and recommendations based on the reality that COVID-19
misinformation is in fact having an impact on mainstream media content.
